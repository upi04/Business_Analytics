E-Commerce Visitor Behavior Dataset
This dataset contains detailed information about visitor activities on an e-commerce website. It is designed to support analyses related to user behavior, conversion optimization, and revenue generation. This dataset is ideal for data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning projects.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

Columns Overview
Administrative: Number of administrative pages visited.
Administrative_Duration: Total time spent on administrative pages (in seconds).
Informational: Number of informational pages visited.
Informational_Duration: Total time spent on informational pages (in seconds).
ProductRelated: Number of product-related pages visited.
ProductRelated_Duration: Total time spent on product-related pages (in seconds).
BounceRates: The percentage of visitors who leave the site after viewing only one page.
ExitRates: The percentage of visitors who leave the site from a particular page.
PageValues: Page-specific metrics that indicate its contribution to revenue.
SpecialDay: Proximity of the visit to a special event or holiday (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas).
Month: The month of the visit (e.g., "Feb" for February).
OperatingSystems: The operating system used by the visitor.
Browser: The type of browser used during the visit.

Revenue: Indicates if the visit resulted in revenue (TRUE/FALSE).
SessionDurationGroup: Categorized session duration (e.g., Short, Medium, Long, Extremely Long).
Purpose of the Dataset
The dataset can be used for various analyses, such as:

Conversion Analysis: Understanding the factors that influence revenue generation.
User Behavior Analysis: Identifying patterns in user engagement with the website.
Traffic Optimization: Exploring how different traffic sources affect site performance.
Impact of Time: Assessing the effect of weekends and special days on user activity.
How to Use
Initial Exploration:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
Use visualizations like scatter plots or bar charts to uncover patterns.
Advanced Analysis:

Conduct regression analysis to identify relationships between variables like BounceRates and Revenue.
Use clustering techniques to segment visitors based on their behavior.
Machine Learning Applications:

Build predictive models to forecast visitor conversion likelihood.
Use classification models to determine factors that impact revenue generation.
Dataset Requirements
Tools: Python, R, Tableau, or other data manipulation platforms.
Suggested Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
