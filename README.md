# Business Analytics on E-Commerce Visitor Behavior Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing visitor behavior on an e-commerce website using a dataset that provides detailed information about user activities. The goal is to understand patterns, optimize conversion rates, and explore revenue generation strategies through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **Administrative**: Number of administrative pages visited.
2. **Administrative_Duration**: Total time spent on administrative pages (in seconds).
3. **Informational**: Number of informational pages visited.
4. **Informational_Duration**: Total time spent on informational pages (in seconds).
5. **ProductRelated**: Number of product-related pages visited.
6. **ProductRelated_Duration**: Total time spent on product-related pages (in seconds).
7. **BounceRates**: The percentage of visitors who leave the site after viewing only one page.
8. **ExitRates**: The percentage of visitors who leave the site from a particular page.
9. **PageValues**: Page-specific metrics that indicate its contribution to revenue.
10. **SpecialDay**: Proximity of the visit to a special event or holiday (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas).
11. **Month**: The month of the visit (e.g., "Feb" for February).
12. **OperatingSystems**: The operating system used by the visitor.
13. **Browser**: The type of browser used during the visit.
14. **Region**: The geographical region of the visitor.
15. **TrafficType**: Source of the website traffic.
16. **VisitorType**: Type of visitor (e.g., Returning Visitor).
17. **Weekend**: Indicates if the visit occurred on a weekend (TRUE/FALSE).
18. **Revenue**: Indicates if the visit resulted in revenue (TRUE/FALSE).
19. **SessionDurationGroup**: Categorized session duration (e.g., Short, Medium, Long, Extremely Long).

## Purpose of the Dataset
The dataset supports various analyses, including:

1. Conversion Analysis**: Understanding the factors that influence revenue generation.
2. User Behavior Analysis**: Identifying patterns in user engagement with the website.
3. Traffic Optimization**: Exploring how different traffic sources affect site performance.
4. Impact of Time**: Assessing the effect of weekends and special days on user activity.

## Steps Taken

 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handle Missing Values**: Identified missing values and filled them with appropriate techniques:
  - For numerical columns, filled with median or mean values.
  - For categorical columns, replaced with "unknown" or a new category.
- **Data Formatting**:
  - Standardized column names and ensured consistent formatting across all entries.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to uncover patterns and relationships:
- **Revenue Analysis**:
  - Visualized the correlation of BounceRates, ExitRates, and PageValues with Revenue.
- **Behavior Analysis**:
  - Examined how ProductRelated_Duration and Informational_Duration affect Revenue.
  - Analyzed session activity based on VisitorType and Weekend.
- **Traffic Analysis**:
  - Explored the impact of TrafficType and Region on Revenue generation.

3. Visualization in Tableau
- Created interactive dashboards and visualizations to present findings:
  - **Scatter Plots**: BounceRates vs. Revenue and ExitRates vs. Revenue.
  - **Bar Charts**: Analyzing categorical features like Browser, OperatingSystems, and VisitorType.
  - **Heatmaps**: Displaying correlations among numerical variables.

4. Insights and Analysis
- Identified key factors influencing revenue generation, such as BounceRates, ExitRates, and time spent on ProductRelated pages.
- Observed that weekends and special days have a noticeable impact on user behavior and conversion rates.
- Traffic sources and regions significantly contribute to variations in revenue.

 and Libraries Used
- **Python**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for basic data visualization.
- **Tableau**:
  - Used for advanced visualization and dashboard creation.

Conclusion
This project provides actionable insights into e-commerce visitor behavior, highlights the importance of user engagement metrics, and demonstrates the value of effective data cleaning and visualization techniques. The results can guide strategies for optimizing conversion rates and enhancing website performance.
